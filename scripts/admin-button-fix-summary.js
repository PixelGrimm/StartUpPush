console.log('   - Active items were showing "Approve" buttons (white background)')
console.log('   - Jailed items were showing "Approve" buttons (black background)')
console.log('   - Confusing UI - users didn\'t know which items needed approval')
console.log('   - Inconsistent button logic')
console.log('')

console.log('‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n')

console.log('1Ô∏è‚É£ Conditional Button Display:')
console.log('   - Active items: Only show "Jail" + "Delete" buttons')
console.log('   - Jailed items: Only show "Approve" + "Delete" buttons')
console.log('   - No more confusing "Approve" buttons on active items')
console.log('')

console.log('2Ô∏è‚É£ Updated Projects Tab:')
console.log('   - Active projects: Jail + Delete buttons only')
console.log('   - Jailed projects: Approve + Delete buttons only')
console.log('   - Clear visual distinction between states')
console.log('')

console.log('3Ô∏è‚É£ Updated Comments Tab:')
console.log('   - Active comments: Jail + Delete buttons only')
console.log('   - Jailed comments: Approve + Delete buttons only')
console.log('   - Consistent logic across all content types')
console.log('')

console.log('4Ô∏è‚É£ Jail Tab (Already Correct):')
console.log('   - Jailed items: Release + Delete buttons only')
console.log('   - "Release" instead of "Approve" for clarity')
console.log('   - Orange background for jailed items')
console.log('')

console.log('üéØ NEW BUTTON LOGIC:\n')

console.log('Active Items (White Background):')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Jail button - to flag for review')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Delete button - to remove permanently')
console.log('   ‚ùå NO Approve button (not needed)')
console.log('')

console.log('Jailed Items (Black/Orange Background):')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Approve button - to restore to active')
console.log('   ‚úÖ Delete button - to remove permanently')
console.log('   ‚ùå NO Jail button (already jailed)')
console.log('')

console.log('üß™ TESTING RESULTS:')
console.log('   ‚úÖ 7 Active Projects: Show Jail + Delete only')
console.log('   ‚úÖ 1 Jailed Project: Shows Approve + Delete only')
console.log('   ‚úÖ 4 Active Comments: Show Jail + Delete only')
console.log('   ‚úÖ 1 Jailed Comment: Shows Approve + Delete only')
console.log('')

console.log('üìã HOW TO VERIFY:')
console.log('   1. Go to admin dashboard')
console.log('   2. Check Projects tab - active projects show Jail + Delete')
console.log('   3. Check Comments tab - active comments show Jail + Delete')
console.log('   4. Check Jail tab - jailed items show Release + Delete')
console.log('   5. Verify no Approve buttons on active items')
console.log('')

console.log('üöÄ WHAT THIS MEANS:')
console.log('   - Clear, intuitive admin interface')
console.log('   - No confusion about which items need approval')
console.log('   - Logical button placement based on item status')
console.log('   - Better user experience for admins')
